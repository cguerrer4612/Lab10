Link to A / B test page from Part 2: https://cguerrer4612.github.io/Lab10/

Explanation: We are using google optimize instead of split.io for A/B testing, hence why we only have one test page that switches half of the time. To report user activity to google analytics we are running a single column test 50% of the time and the double column the other 50% of the time.
